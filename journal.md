Slowly realised making this could turn into a time sink...

Current plan is: I'll start with Jekyll and make a simple static site &mdash; and then eventually upgrade to a proper thing with React when I get around to doing COMP6080/studying ahead for it.

Main requirements:
- Landing page/about
    - Should list some projects I'm proud of
- Resume link (in that plain academic format and easily printable as a `.pdf`)
- A blog
- Page for uni notes
- (maybe) a page for all my horticultural experiments/nature things I like
- (maybe) some fun interactive widget? like a Shell or a fun game or something.
- (maybe) ability for people to leave comments, message/contact me easily

Have drawn up some ideas on paper but it feels very clunky having everything as separate pages; just not really sure how to make it feel more integrated. I think it'd be much nicer if it looked something like a Wiki with a navbar/contents bar on the side. But for now I'll stick to a simpler design until I have better ideas because I just need something that works.

Hey!

I’m Grant, a computer science/statistics student at UNSW.

I have a frustratingly wide range of interests I’m forever trying to narrow down, but it all tends to circulate around things systems-related, backend or algorithmic.

My current focus has been on improving my knowledge of the design and analysis of algorithms, and machine learning.

Here’s some stuff I made:
-	[`sydney-train-game-solver`](https://github.com/grantzeng/sydney-train-game-solver)
-	(Watch this space!)

I’m planning to keep a semi-regular blog of (obscure?) technical content [here](https://grantzeng.github.io)

### "Hi Super Nintendeo Chalmers! I'm learding."
Technologies I frequently use:
-	Python (Python is basically pseudocode isn't it)

Things I am currently trying to become more competent at:
- Frontend engineering (6080 basically. Experiment in whether I'd like to become a web dev.)
- Machine learning. (There some data science involved/resolving practical issues with dealing with data that was never covered in statistics; mostly just experiments in whether I'd like to become a data scientist/applied scientist)
- Functional programming, Haskell.
- System design (Basically trying to wrap my head around OOP, I took 2511 too early in my degree, so really trying to get this stuff to sink in again. )

Things which look really interesting but having to put on the backburner for now for lack of actual use cases.
-	~~Rust, Go, C++/C~~
-   ~~Linux (_TO-DO_: Put Linux on a toaster)~~
-	~~_Systems programming_: operating systems, databases, networks, compilers~~
-	~~Cloud computing, AWS, distributed systems~~
-	~~Platform engineering, infrastructure~~
-	~~FPGAs, digital circuits and design~~
-	~~Informal methods (see: COMP6721)~~
-	~~Stochastic processes, differential equations, probability, Bayesian statistics, stuff for COMP9418~~ (Maths is on hold for now.)
-  ~~Computationally intensive aspects of data science and machine learning/deep learning~~

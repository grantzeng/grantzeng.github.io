Hey!

I’m Grant, a computer science/statistics student at UNSW.

I have a frustratingly wide range of interests I’m perpetually trying to narrow down, but it all tends to circulate around things systems-related, backend or algorithmic.
Current focus has been on improving my knowledge of the design and analysis of algorithms, and machine learning.

Here’s some stuff I made:
-	[`sydney-train-game-solver`](https://github.com/grantzeng/sydney-train-game-solver)
-	(Watch this space!)

I’m planning to keep a semi-regular blog of (obscure?) technical content [here](https://grantzeng.github.io)

### Things technical
Technologies I frequently use:
-	Python
-	Shell (Shell’s great, I love it because it’s so horrendously janky)
-	SQLite

Things I want to learn more about:
-	Rust | Go | C++/C | Linux
-	Systems programming: operating systems, databases, networks, compilers
-	Cloud computing, AWS, distributed systems
-	Platform engineering, infrastructure, DevOps
-	FPGAs, digital circuits
-	Functional programming/Haskell
-	System design (TO-DO: Read ‘A Philosophy of Software Design’)
-	Informal methods (TO-DO: see Carroll Morgan’s course notes)
-	React/Typescript/frontend engineering (just enough to visualise my technical projects)
-	Maths: Stochastic processes, differential equations, probability. (ON-HOLD:  it’d mostly be for fun, but just at the moment I lack actual use-cases)

And now for something completely different

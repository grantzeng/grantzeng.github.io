Hey!

I’m Grant, a computer science/statistics student at UNSW.

I have a frustratingly wide range of interests I’m forever trying to narrow down, but it all tends to circulate around things systems-related, backend or algorithmic.

My current focus has been on improving my knowledge of the design and analysis of algorithms, and machine learning.

Here’s some stuff I made:
-	[`sydney-train-game-solver`](https://github.com/grantzeng/sydney-train-game-solver)
-	(Watch this space!)

I’m planning to keep a semi-regular blog of (obscure?) technical content [here](https://grantzeng.github.io)

### Things technical
Technologies I frequently use:
-	Python
-	Shell (Shell’s great, I love it because it’s so horrendously janky)
-	SQLite

Things I want to learn more about:
-	Rust, Go, C++/C
-   Linux (_TO-DO_: Put Linux on a toaster)
-	_Systems programming_: operating systems, databases, networks, compilers
-	Cloud computing, AWS, distributed systems
-	Platform engineering, infrastructure
-	FPGAs, digital circuits and design
-	Functional programming, Haskell
-	System design
-	Informal methods (see: COMP6721)
-	React/Typescript/frontend engineering (just enough to visualise/make nice UIs for my technical projects)
-	_Maths_: Stochastic processes, differential equations, probability. (only for fun; I've put this project on-hold for lack of actual use-cases.)
-  Computationally intensive aspects of data science and machine learning/deep learning
